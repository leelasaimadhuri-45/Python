# Python
This repository contains Python programs for basic mathematical operations and personalized greetings. Each program demonstrates fundamental Python concepts like user input, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations.
## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers.  
2. It converts the user input into numerical values (integers or floats).  
3. It performs the following operations using Python arithmetic operators:  
   - **Addition (`+`)**: Adds the two numbers.  
   - **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.  
   - **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies the two numbers.  
   - **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first number by the second.  
4. The program prints the result of each operation with a descriptive message.  

**Example Process:**  
- User inputs `10` and `5`.  
- Program calculates:  
  - Addition → 10 + 5 = 15  
  - Subtraction → 10 - 5 = 5  
  - Multiplication → 10 * 5 = 50  
  - Division → 10 / 5 = 2.0  
- Program displays each result on the screen.

  ## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
  1. The program prompts the user to enter their **first name** and **last name**.  
2. It combines (concatenates) the first and last names to form a **full name**.  
3. The program generates a personalized greeting message using the full name.  
4. It displays the greeting on the screen using the `print()` function.  

**Example Process:**  
- User inputs first name: `Leela`  
- User inputs last name: `Sai Madhuri`  
- Program combines them to create `Leela Sai Madhuri`  
- Program prints: `Hello, Leela Sai Madhuri! Welcome to the program.`
